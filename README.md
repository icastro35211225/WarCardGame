(S)ingle Responsibility Principle
My Card class is an example of the single responsibility principle since all it does is store the rank, suit, and value of the Card object. As well as just getters and setters.

(O)pen Closed Principle
My War interface implementation is an example since the War interface implements default classes that can be overidden by the classes that implemnet it.

(L)iskov Substitution Principle
An example is my Main class that can use any of the subclasses for the War inteface.

(I)nterface Segregation Principle
An example is how I implemented my Player interface and its subclasses. Separating Player for each War game type: the regular game, and the card pile version of the game.
